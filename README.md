# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a deep-learning neural network to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
   - The target for this model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column from the dataset, the binary variable that shows if a charitable donation was used effectively or not. 

   - The features for this model are the application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization, status, income amount, special considerations, and ask amount variables. 
   - The EIN and Name variables are neither targets nor features and therefore were removed from the input data. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
   - Since we have 
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
